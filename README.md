# colorPicker

Here is the deployed working site => https://pt-color-picker.netlify.app/
<ul>
  <li>
    I have made up my own color picker. With that I can create 5 shades of selected color.
  </li>
  <li>
    I have used API from "https://www.thecolorapi.com" to get the 5 shades of selected color.
  </li>
  <li>
    Also added a functionality to select the type of shade user want to generate, Ex - Monochrome, Monochrome-Dark, Monochrome-Light, Analogic etc..
  </li>
  <li>
    Added a functionality to change the font color according to the contrast of selected Color.
  </li>
</ul>
