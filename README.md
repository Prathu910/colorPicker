# colorPicker
I have made up my own color picker. With that I can create 5 shades of selected color.
I have used API from "https://www.thecolorapi.com" to get the 5 shades of selected color.
Also added a functionality to select the type of shade user want to generate, Ex - Monochrome, Monochrome-Dark, Monochrome-Light, Analogic etc..
Added a functionality to change the font color according to the contrast of selected Color.
